# Hi There!
I'm a developer who mainly specializes in object oriented languages. 
I have experience in creating applications, working with APIs and maintaining servers, either hosted myself or a VPS.

Below is a full list of everything I do or know.
#

### Languages I work with
- **C#** (Used for almost every project because of its versatility and syntactical sugar.)
- **Kotlin** (Used for Android development and as a great replacement for Java.)
- **C & ZIG** (Used if I need low level hardware access and blazing fast speeds.)
- **JS, Html, CSS, Astro & Vue** (Used as my general go-to for web development, since I still haven't found a good framework.)
- **Lua & Python** (Used as my go-to languages for scripting and creating quick small projects.)

#

### Technologies I'm familiar with
- **Object-oriented programming**
- **Data-oriented programming**
- **Docker**
- **Docker-compose**
- **REST APIs**
- **Virtualization**
- **Blockchains**
- **SSH, SCP & SFTP**

#

### IDEs and Editors I use
- **JetBrains Rider** (Everything related to C# and .Net)
- **JetBrains Webstorm** (Everything for Web development, React, Vue.Js, Typescript etc.)
- **JetBrains IntelliJ** (Everything that is related to the JVM or Android development)
- **JetBrains CLion** (Mainly used for C and C++, although I also use Neovim for a lot of C development)
- **VSCodium** (Scripting languages and feature rich text editor)
- **Neovim** (Go-to text editor on Linux and used for low-level languages like C and C++)
